            <p>Hello! My first name is Hanh, or you can call me Hannah. I am from Vietnam. I have just arrived Canada on December 13<sup>th</sup>, 2023. I am studying <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> at Algonquin College. And this is my assignment for the course <em>Web Development I</em>. After finishing this program, I would become a UX Designer to create the best websites.

            <p>I love to travel. This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> time to live in a foreign country. Previously, I had lived in <abbr title="New Zealand">NZ</abbr> for a year in 2017. This time, my aim to extend my stay in Canada. I want to study and work here to embrace the new life in this huge country. This is a quote that I really like:</p>
